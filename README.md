# Clothes Configurator Ontology Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Clothes Configurator Ontology Project! This project aims to develop a comprehensive and flexible ontology for a clothes configurator application. The ontology will provide a structured framework to represent various clothing items, their attributes, relationships, and customization options. This project will facilitate the development of applications that allow users to mix and match clothing items to create personalized outfits.

## Features

- **Detailed Clothing Taxonomy**: Categorize clothing items into a well-defined hierarchy (e.g., tops, bottoms, outerwear, accessories).
- **Attribute Specification**: Define attributes for each clothing item, such as size, color, material, brand, and style.
- **Customization Options**: Incorporate customizable features like color selection, pattern choice, and size adjustments.
- **Relationship Mapping**: Establish relationships between different clothing items (e.g., outfits, seasonal collections).
- **Compatibility Rules**: Implement rules for combining clothing items based on style, occasion, and compatibility.
- **Extensibility**: Design the ontology to be easily extendable for future enhancements and new clothing categories.

## Project Structure

- **src/**: Contains the source code for the ontology and related scripts.
- **data/**: Includes sample data sets used for testing and validation.
- **docs/**: Documentation files, including the project overview, installation guide, and usage instructions.
- **tests/**: Unit tests and test cases to ensure the functionality and integrity of the ontology.
- **examples/**: Example configurations and use cases demonstrating the ontology's application.
